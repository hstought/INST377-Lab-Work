<h1>Henry Stought Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

<p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
</ul>

<p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Beerbongs and Bentleys</li>
    <li>Full Moon Fever</li>
    <li>Born In The U.S.A.</li>
    <li>Born To Run</li>
    <li>Donda</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <i>draw attention to something</i> in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <i><strong>do both</strong></i>.</p>

<h3>Empty Elements</h3>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. 
<br> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. <hr>


<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<img src="client/lab_1/images/mochi.jpg" alt="mochi jpg">

<hr>

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
